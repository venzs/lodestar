# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Initial suite: Lodestar (core), Lodestar_Leveling, Lodestar_Economy, Lodestar_UI, Lodestar_Guild.
- Lodestar_Guide: navigation arrow with smart quest targeting, guide engine + text format, route recorder.
- Lodestar_Guides_Horde: draft Undead Deathknell route (verify with the recorder).
- Targets WoW: Forever beta 1.60.1 (Interface 16001).
- Guild: works without addon comms. When the realm restricts addon messages (`AreOutgoingAddonChatMessagesRestricted`, true everywhere on the beta) nothing is sent or queued, the heartbeat stays off, the board shows the C_Club roster with a notice, and `/lode lfg` puts `/g LFG: <text>` in the chat box for you to send. Comms resume automatically on `ADDON_RESTRICTION_STATE_CHANGED`.
- Leveling: status strip under the XP readout (free bag slots, lowest durability, rested % of level, resting state, watched buffs such as Well Fed) with chat nags at 2 free slots / 20 % durability, one per five minutes each, each with its own toggle.
- Leveling: "turn-ins to ding" — the XP readout, its tooltip and the minimap tooltip show the reward XP of quests ready to turn in and whether it covers the rest of the level.
